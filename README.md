# **ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR AIRLINE PASSENGER'S SATISFACTION USING PYSPARK**
We wanted to understand what factors make airline passengers more or less satisfied with their flight experience. By studying this, airlines could improve services and prioritize what passengers care most about.

To do this, we employed four machine learning models (logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree) to help predict whether a passenger is satisfied or not based on other related information such as the comfort of the seats, inflight Wi-Fi service, distance traveled, etc. We were also able to determine which factors are most important for passenger satisfaction.
