# **ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR AIRLINE PASSENGER'S SATISFACTION USING PYSPARK**
The rapid growth of airline travel and large volume of data in the industry has necessitated advanced tools to analyse and predict passenger satisfaction, a critical factor in maintaining competitive advantage. This study employs PySpark to implement machine learning models for predicting airline passenger satisfaction. The dataset, consisting more than 120,000 records of passenger feedback across various categories, was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and assemble feature vectors. Four machine learning models, logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and gradient boosted trees (GBT) were trained, evaluated, and also optimized through hyperparameter tuning. The results revealed that ensemble models outperformed linear models in the predictive performance, achieving accuracy of 96% after tuning. Feature importance analysis highlighted technological service quality, travel type, and customer type as significant contributors to satisfaction predictions. Additionally, the study observed consistent evaluation metrics across models, underscoring the robustness of the PySpark framework in handling large, complex datasets. This research demonstrates the applicability of big data analytics in customer satisfaction analysis and provides a pathway for future studies to enhance airline customer experience through data driven insights. The findings emphasize the critical role of machine learning in transforming passenger feedback into actionable strategies for airlines.
